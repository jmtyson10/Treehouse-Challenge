        <h1>CSS Length Units</h1>
        <p>
          Length units are CSS measurement values consisting of a number
          followed by either an absolute or a relative unit. There should be no
          space separating the number and the unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lengths can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as
          <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code>,
          <code>padding</code>, <code>border-width</code>,
          <code>font-size</code>, and <code>text-shadow</code>.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Absolute Length Units</h2>
          <p>
            Absolute length units are not relative to anything else, and are
            always considered to be the same size. The most common absolute
            length unit is the pixel. <code>1px</code> represents one dot of
            illumination on a display screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            While CSS accepts other length units such as <code>in</code> and
            <code>cm</code>, you won’t typically use these unless you’re
            creating a print style sheet using a CSS media query.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Relative Length Units</h2>
          <p>
            Relative length units are relative to something else. This could be
            to the width of a parent element, the size of a parent element’s
            font, or the size of the viewport.
          </p>
          <p>
            When working with typography in CSS, the most common length units
            are the <code>em</code> and the <code>rem</code>. While
            <code>em</code> is relative to the font-size of its direct or
            nearest parent, <code>rem</code> is only relative to the html (root)
            font-size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viewport-percentage length units such as <code>vw</code> and
            <code>vh</code> are relative to the size of the viewport.
            <code>1vw</code> is equivalent to 1% of the width of the viewport.
          </p>
          <h3>Percentage Units</h3>
          <p>
            Although
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length"
              >technically not a length unit</a
            >, percentage values can be used in many of the same properties that
            accept length values.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            But what are they percentages <em>of</em>? It depends entirely on
            the property! For the <code>width</code> and
            <code>margin-left</code> properties, it’s a percentage of “the width
            of the containing block”. For the <code>line-height property</code>,
            it’s a percentage of “the font size of the element itself”. And so
            on, with rather idiosyncratic semantics for each CSS property.

            Note that although <code>padding-top</code>,
            <code>padding-bottom</code>, <code>margin-top</code>, and
            <code>margin-bottom</code> are vertical measurements, when using
            percentages these measurements are based on the <em>width</em> of
            the containing block.
